# FMCW-radar-simulator-for-Non-contact-vital-signs-monitoring-research-purposes

## Introduction
A GUI that enables researchers to generate a FMCW radar data with human presence in front of the radar. The simulator enables user to add multiple humans in front of the radar at different ranges, as well as static objects.

## Features 
Avails changing radar's configurations
- No. samples per chirp
- Starting frequency
- Bandwith
- Sampling frequency
- Chirp duration
- FPS
- Noise level
  
Calculates radar parameters due to selected configurations
- Max range
- Range resolution "frequency wise"
- Range resolution "phase/angle wise"
